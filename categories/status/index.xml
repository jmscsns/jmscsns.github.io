      <description>The very idea of having doctors write prescriptions for money off energy bills is bizarre. That the Treasury are flying the kite in a national paper is madness. It all just adds to the idea that the UK is teetering on the brink of breakdown.

      <description>I can’t remember how long I’ve been trying to buy one. Now it’s here, I’m almost scared to open it. </description>

      <description>Currently in the nesting phase of holiday gestation; tidying and organising everything to within an inch of its life.</description>

      <description>I’m not sure exactly how an mRNA vaccine works, but having had my booster yesterday I spent most of today asleep or feeling awful. Then, since five, I’ve felt absolutely great.</description>

      <description>The combination of ambiguous phrasing and anonymous initials makes me wonder what they did in those ‘happy hours’. (As well as making me very fond of Mrs Macfarlane.) </description>
