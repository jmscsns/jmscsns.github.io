      <description>There is no escaping that we are living through an historic period. The first change of the UK’s head of state in just over 70 years. The loss of a figure known, and loved, throughout the world. The death of The Queen.
So, why am I so unaffected by it?
There is absolutely no escaping the supposed enormity of the moment. All media are full of the news, retrospectives of The Queen’s life, coverage of the mourning events, explanations of a succession process that 90% of people will never have seen in their lifetime.</description>
