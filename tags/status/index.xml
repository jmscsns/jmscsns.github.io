      <description>The very idea of having doctors write prescriptions for money off energy bills is bizarre. That the Treasury are flying the kite in a national paper is madness. It all just adds to the idea that the UK is teetering on the brink of breakdown. DOC BILL HELP PLAN The Sun</description>

      <description>I can’t remember how long I’ve been trying to buy one. Now it’s here, I’m almost scared to open it. </description>

      <description>As a sporadic, and not very good, photographer, it’s nice to get a picture used by the BBC for an article. Not a massive news story, and I think Grimsby has far bigger problems than the clock, but nice for the ego. </description>

      <description>Much as I am enjoying iOS 15 (despite the havoc Safari is playing with my muscle memory), I&amp;rsquo;m not quite so keen on the subtle changes that seem to have destroyed every single one of my tortuously complicated Shortcuts.</description>

      <description>Is it a government reshuffle, or is it just Johnson trolling a nation? Nadine Dorries? In the Cabinet? So hard to see how she&amp;rsquo;s better than, say, even the lamentable Williamson, who&amp;rsquo;s out.</description>

      <description>Got a Literal.club account, hoping a shiny new site would help me reboot my lapsed reading habit. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the criticism. </description>

      <description>My first trip to the cinema since December 2019. I had quite forgotten how (once you are past the initial irritation) the reactive rustling of wrappers, murmurs, and throat-clearing add to the shared experience of movie watching!</description>
