      <title>On the death of The Queen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no escaping that we are living through an historic period. The first change of the UK’s head of state in just over 70 years. The loss of a figure known, and loved, throughout the world. The death of The Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why am I so unaffected by it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely no escaping the supposed enormity of the moment. All media are full of the news, retrospectives of The Queen’s life, coverage of the mourning events, explanations of a succession process that 90% of people will never have seen in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there has clearly been a genuine outpouring of emotion from people, ordinary people, who are going through feelings of grief and loss. But I feel none of them. It is a peculiar position to be in. A sense that I, somehow, must be at fault. That there is some mental or emotional failing that leaves me unable to share the feelings of loss that are ‘normal’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might be down to my beliefs. I am a republican, and view a hereditary monarchy as a mix between being faintly ridiculous in the modern age, and offering a lack of transparency and accountability that’s incompatible with democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But republicanism does not divorce me from reality or humanity. The Queen has been head of state for my entire life, a constant that peered down from portraits and up from banknotes, the ever-present at national moments. And every death is a tragedy, leaving a host of family and friends with a grief they will have to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, possibly, is why I feel so unaffected. The Queen, to me, was more symbol than living person. While I was, on a few occasions, in the same room as her, it was a surreal experience. Briefings beforehand served to highlight that they were someone apart, a monarch, rather than a person. While I know others got to see a different side to her, I did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to deny or belittle those who are genuinely affected by her death. Obviously, her loved ones will be feeling the pain most acutely — and I do wonder how able they are to process their grief when there is a spotlight on them in public, and a seemingly endless list of succession-related pageantry in private. And I know there will be those with no connection to the Royal Family who are feeling a loss that might be just as real and painful as for a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while I can see it in others, I cannot feel it in myself, and will just have to accept that is my failing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My mother, the pessimist</title>
      <link>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/22-09-06-my-mother-the-pessimist/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 19:18:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/22-09-06-my-mother-the-pessimist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps all children are cursed and, eventually, become their parents. And so, I find myself, increasingly, adopting views and traits that I recognise as theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One I have become very aware of is my mother’s pessimism. It wasn’t a mild pessimism, the glum prediction of rain on a sunny day, but a doom-laden vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the news contained stories of another nation’s despair — the death tolls of famines, the disease-ridden refugee camps of civil war — she would see our future. “That will be us in thirty years,” she would assert. The timeframe might change, but it was always likely to be in my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would scoff. We lived in a wonderful age. Society was becoming kinder, the world more civilised, technology revolutionising our lives. The world, or more precisely, our world, could only get better. The fact that science had not advanced enough to prevent her death shortly after I became an adult did nothing to diminish my general optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since she died, my memories have faded, and I’ve tried to keep the happier ones alive. But now I wish I remembered more of her pessimism, partly because I find myself become despondent about the future, partly because I wonder if she had instinctively seen where things were heading. And as we start to bump up against some of her shorter timeframes of pessimism, I wonder if she would recognise where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome a new Prime Minister today, but not with enthusiasm. It is a country where &lt;a href=&#34;https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8585/&#34;&gt;food banks hand out more than two million emergency food parcels a year&lt;/a&gt;. A country where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/warm-bank-cost-of-living-b2156758.html&#34;&gt;many cities are planning to establish ‘warm banks’&lt;/a&gt; to help people through the winter. A proud &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62806709&#34;&gt;maritime nation surrounded by a sea of its own sewage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than bringing hope and change, the new administration seems committed to more of the same. Energy bills will be frozen, we are told, but that will be done with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62801913&#34;&gt;a massive handout to businesses, so they can keep their profits&lt;/a&gt;, with taxpayers footing the costs in future years. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/03/unions-call-for-liz-truss-to-come-clean-over-plans-to-change-workers-rights&#34;&gt;Employee rights will be cut back&lt;/a&gt; because the Prime Minister believes British people are shirkers, and bosses are the ones that need more power. Instead, people will be incentivised by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62786336&#34;&gt;tax cuts for the rich because they are fair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should, perhaps, be grateful for all this. My parents gave me a great start, supporting me through an education and start of a career path that means I’m unlikely to be needing a food or warm bank. Indeed, we might even benefit from a tax cut. But at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are becoming an increasingly unequal society, and now have a government that seems to revel in that. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41264965&#34;&gt;Food banks are seen as uplifting&lt;/a&gt;, rather than evidence of a problem that needs to be solved. So, instead of trying to improve the lot of the nation, the focus appears to be improving the lot of the better-off, in the hope that everyone else gets some of the scraps that fall from the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that simply doesn’t work. My parents were unskilled working class, they earned enough to buy a small house in a cheap area, and put food on the table for most of the week. (Bread and jam was a frequent payday-eve meal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, that would simply be impossible. Unable to buy a house, they would have found themselves struggling with increasing rents. Their jobs, rather than secure employment, would almost certainly have been zero-hour contracts. The family’s mental bandwidth would have been swallowed by the daily grind of keeping heads above water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now I have my mother’s pessimism. And looking back, I realise that all those news stories never covered the people who were doing all right. The people whose circumstances meant they survived, and even thrived, while their fellow citizens struggled and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wonder if they, too, felt the same impotent anger and shame, knowing that while they might be able to help around the edges, when governments and systems have inequality baked into them, the outlook for many, many people will never be anything but bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entirely my fault for not planning ahead, but am always taken by surprise at how slow US banking is. European transfers are complete before the confirmation page loads, in the US, well, maybe next week. Sometime. If you’re lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The very idea of having doctors write prescriptions for money off energy bills is bizarre. That the Treasury are flying the kite in a national paper is madness. It all just adds to the idea that the UK is teetering on the brink of breakdown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19569772/doctors-money-prescription-energy-bills/&#34;&gt;DOC BILL HELP PLAN &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure exactly how an mRNA vaccine works, but having had my booster yesterday I spent most of today asleep or feeling awful. Then, since five, I’ve felt absolutely great.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A year without work</title>
      <link>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-11-04-year-without-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:51:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-11-04-year-without-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve now gone just over a year since I last ‘worked’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure how deliberate this has been. The preceding eighteen months saw a couple of disastrous career moves, but my last day of work arrived much sooner than I’d anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month into a three-month notice period, I trekked into work as usual. I was feeling unusually tired, but thought little of it. Then Test and Trace rang to follow up on my positive Covid-19 test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d taken the test a week before, a precaution after Covid-19 swept through my workplace. The hospital lab (I was working in the NHS) had reported a negative result, but I headed home to self-isolate to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quickly apparent who was right, by the afternoon I had developed symptoms. Over the few days I experienced, except for the cough, almost every symptom that has been associated with the virus. I was fortunate, though, that I only had one night of breathing difficulties. I cannot imagine the fear experienced by those who needed hospitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatigue was the biggest problem. Three months later I was still asleep half the day and even moderate exercise would write off the next twenty-four hours. Even today, I feel the after-effects, although I attribute these more to my general loss of fitness over the first six months than the virus directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it put paid to my plans to find a new job. I’d started my hunt and had to turn down an interview and a few recruiters while I was self-isolating. I was, however, fortunate to have a supportive family and a bit of cash in the bank to tide me over. There was no immediate danger, but there was the challenge of finding a job when I spent a lot of my time asleep and lacked stamina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has turned out I didn’t need to find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I put myself on a freelancing site offering copywriting. I charged peanuts, my thinking was that earning a few quid was better than earning nothing. And, at least, it gave me something to put on the CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I earned a few quid. My perfectionist agonising over every word meant my hourly rate was probably pennies. But one job led to another, and another, and another. I quickly became overwhelmed. So, I increased my rates to limit the demand. But then it happened again. And again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without really planning anything, I’ve got to a stage where I’m making ends meet. And that’s largely by working half-days with cheap rates. (Covid-19 has helped too. Our expenditure on restaurants and holidays is not what it was.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what to make of all of this. Thinking back, I always enjoyed writing and, when the opportunity presented at work or elsewhere, relished the opportunity to play with words. But although I’d been paid for a few bits of writing, it was never something I imagined I could live on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even writing this, the imposter syndrome creeps in: who on earth would pay someone who writes dross like this? It’s simply laughable to compare myself with ‘real’ writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my more confident moments, though, I think there are two things that stick out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am incredibly fortunate to be in the position where I could do this. Few people could afford the risk of trying it, let alone stumbling into it as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, doing something you genuinely enjoy, that you find rewarding, where the senses are satisfied (and how I love the rhythmic sounds and light touch of my keyboard), just does not feel like work. Flow comes easily. Pleasing phrases and passages present themselves. Pieces magically appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the future will hold. Perhaps I will tire of trying to pretend I’m a writer (or copywriter). Perhaps I will stumble across a job I cannot refuse. Perhaps someone will rumble me and everyone will find out this emperor is as naked as the day they were born. All I can do is enjoy it while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The combination of ambiguous phrasing and anonymous initials makes me wonder what they did in those ‘happy hours’. (As well as making me very fond of Mrs Macfarlane.) &lt;img src=&#34;https://blinkingblimey.com/images/mrsmacfarlane.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mrs Macfarlene bench memorial&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just spent an age tinkering with Github Actions and Pages to automate building a Hugo site. Something I imagine many people would do in moments, but there&amp;rsquo;s a real sense joy in accomplishing even something that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a sporadic, and not very good, photographer, it’s nice to get a picture &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-58718921&#34;&gt;used by the BBC for an article&lt;/a&gt;. Not a massive news story, and I think Grimsby has far bigger problems than the clock, but nice for the ego. &lt;img src=&#34;https://blinkingblimey.com/images/grimsbyminster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grimsby Minster at night&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first trip to the cinema since December 2019. I had quite forgotten how (once you are past the initial irritation) the reactive rustling of wrappers, murmurs, and throat-clearing add to the shared experience of movie watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging like it’s 2008</title>
      <link>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-09-08-blogginglikeits2008/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-09-08-blogginglikeits2008/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started tinkering with websites in the late 90s. Hand coding the HTML and learning cutting-edge techniques like frames and image maps to wring the potential out of Netscape Navigator. My first domain came in 2000, but it wasn’t until 2008 when I started blogging properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is still technically alive — although I suspect that if I re-read it, I might experience life-threatening cringing — but for all practical purposes is died in the early 2010s. The posts were in a rut, and the drafts folder was full of snippets that were full of promise, but impaled on the spike of self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is that the early blogging was an incredibly positive experience for me. I learned a lot just through the work of maintaining and writing it. It resulted in meeting people I still know and keep in touch with, and even generated a good chunk of work, some of it for organisations I’m still involved with. There was a frisson of excitement attached to blogging, and I was suddenly nostalgic for it when doom-scrolling Twitter one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was always a dopamine hit with Twitter. I was a fairly early adopter of it, before I started blogging, and remember being at an unconference (which I was involved in through blogging) talking to someone else about our excitement at both passing 100 followers. And we were both following everyone back because it was about conversation and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the dopamine hit comes from broadcasting your fixed opinions, reading things you agree with while blocking or muting people you think are idiots. It has long since ceased to be a venue for healthy debate or discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is an attempt to return to 2008. If nothing else, I had fun setting up Hugo and GitHub Pages, ticking the wannabe geek box. It’s a bit out of the way of my main site, using a domain which, for some reason, I bought years ago. The distance will hopefully stop the self-censorship. And it’s deliberately disconnected from things like Twitter, connected only to micro-blog, which, I think, has more of an early Twitter vibe to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might all stutter and fade after this post, but at least I’ll have given it a go. If I’m going to stop having a personal internet presence, I want to dump it saying “it wasn’t me, it’s you.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent a chunk of time this weekend tinkering with a new blog I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to put some content on the damn thing. Cue loss of inspiration, followed by crippling self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
