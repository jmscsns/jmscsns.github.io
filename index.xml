      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a sporadic, and not very good, photographer, it’s nice to get a picture &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-58718921&#34;&gt;used by the BBC for an article&lt;/a&gt;. Not a massive news story, and I think Grimsby has far bigger problems than the clock, but nice for the ego. &lt;img src=&#34;https://blinkingblimey.com/images/grimsbyminster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grimsby Minster at night&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m coming to the conclusion that all there is to be found at the intersection of iOS and iPadOS 15 and iCloud is a horrible buggy mess.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much as I am enjoying iOS 15 (despite the havoc Safari is playing with my muscle memory), I&amp;rsquo;m not quite so keen on the subtle changes that seem to have destroyed every single one of my tortuously complicated Shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it a government reshuffle, or is it just Johnson trolling a nation? Nadine Dorries? In the Cabinet? So hard to see how she&amp;rsquo;s better than, say, even the lamentable Williamson, who&amp;rsquo;s out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://literal.club&#34;&gt;Literal.club&lt;/a&gt; account, hoping a shiny new site would help me reboot my lapsed reading habit. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the criticism. &lt;img src=&#34;https://blinkingblimey.com/images/literalcriticism.png&#34; alt=&#34;Literal.club&amp;rsquo;s hurtful criticism&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My favourite thing about Apple keynotes is how, every year, they remind me that I could be a great photographer. I just need a marginally better camera in my pocket than I have carried for the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first trip to the cinema since December 2019. I had quite forgotten how (once you are past the initial irritation) the reactive rustling of wrappers, murmurs, and throat-clearing add to the shared experience of movie watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging like it’s 2008</title>
      <link>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-09-08-blogginglikeits2008/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 16:31:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-09-08-blogginglikeits2008/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started tinkering with websites in the late 90s. Hand coding the HTML and learning cutting-edge techniques like frames and image maps to wring the potential out of Netscape Navigator. My first domain came in 2000, but it wasn’t until 2008 when I started blogging properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is still technically alive — although I suspect that if I re-read it, I might experience life-threatening cringing — but for all practical purposes is died in the early 2010s. The posts were in a rut, and the drafts folder was full of snippets that were full of promise, but impaled on the spike of self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is that the early blogging was an incredibly positive experience for me. I learned a lot just through the work of maintaining and writing it. It resulted in meeting people I still know and keep in touch with, and even generated a good chunk of work, some of it for organisations I’m still involved with. There was a frisson of excitement attached to blogging, and I was suddenly nostalgic for it when doom-scrolling Twitter one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was always a dopamine hit with Twitter. I was a fairly early adopter of it, before I started blogging, and remember being at an unconference (which I was involved in through blogging) talking to someone else about our excitement at both passing 100 followers. And we were both following everyone back because it was about conversation and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the dopamine hit comes from broadcasting your fixed opinions, reading things you agree with while blocking or muting people you think are idiots. It has long since ceased to be a venue for healthy debate or discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is an attempt to return to 2008. If nothing else, I had fun setting up Hugo and GitHub Pages, ticking the wannabe geek box. It’s a bit out of the way of my main site, using a domain which, for some reason, I bought years ago. The distance will hopefully stop the self-censorship. And it’s deliberately disconnected from things like Twitter, connected only to micro-blog, which, I think, has more of an early Twitter vibe to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might all stutter and fade after this post, but at least I’ll have given it a go. If I’m going to stop having a personal internet presence, I want to dump it saying “it wasn’t me, it’s you.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent a chunk of time this weekend tinkering with a new blog I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to put some content on the damn thing. Cue loss of inspiration, followed by crippling self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
