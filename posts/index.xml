      <description>I started tinkering with websites in the late 90s. Hand coding the HTML and learning cutting-edge techniques like frames and image maps to wring the potential out of Netscape Navigator. My first domain came in 2000, but it wasn’t until 2008 when I started blogging properly.
My blog is still technically alive — although I suspect that if I re-read it, I might experience life-threatening cringing — but for all practical purposes is died in the early 2010s.</description>

      <description>Having spent a chunk of time this weekend tinkering with a new blog I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to put some content on the damn thing. Cue loss of inspiration, followed by crippling self-censorship.</description>
