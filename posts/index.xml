      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just spent an age tinkering with Github Actions and Pages to automate building a Hugo site. Something I imagine many people would do in moments, but there&amp;rsquo;s a real sense joy in accomplishing even something that simple.</description>

      <description>As a sporadic, and not very good, photographer, it’s nice to get a picture used by the BBC for an article. Not a massive news story, and I think Grimsby has far bigger problems than the clock, but nice for the ego. </description>

      <description>I’m coming to the conclusion that all there is to be found at the intersection of iOS and iPadOS 15 and iCloud is a horrible buggy mess.</description>

      <description>Much as I am enjoying iOS 15 (despite the havoc Safari is playing with my muscle memory), I&amp;rsquo;m not quite so keen on the subtle changes that seem to have destroyed every single one of my tortuously complicated Shortcuts.</description>

      <description>Is it a government reshuffle, or is it just Johnson trolling a nation? Nadine Dorries? In the Cabinet? So hard to see how she&amp;rsquo;s better than, say, even the lamentable Williamson, who&amp;rsquo;s out.</description>

      <description>Got a Literal.club account, hoping a shiny new site would help me reboot my lapsed reading habit. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the criticism. </description>

      <description>My favourite thing about Apple keynotes is how, every year, they remind me that I could be a great photographer. I just need a marginally better camera in my pocket than I have carried for the past year.</description>

      <description>My first trip to the cinema since December 2019. I had quite forgotten how (once you are past the initial irritation) the reactive rustling of wrappers, murmurs, and throat-clearing add to the shared experience of movie watching!</description>

      <title>Blogging like it’s 2008</title>
      <link>https://blinkingblimey.com/posts/21-09-08-blogginglikeits2008/</link>

      <description>I started tinkering with websites in the late 90s. Hand coding the HTML and learning cutting-edge techniques like frames and image maps to wring the potential out of Netscape Navigator. My first domain came in 2000, but it wasn’t until 2008 when I started blogging properly.
My blog is still technically alive — although I suspect that if I re-read it, I might experience life-threatening cringing — but for all practical purposes is died in the early 2010s.</description>

      <description>Having spent a chunk of time this weekend tinkering with a new blog I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to put some content on the damn thing. Cue loss of inspiration, followed by crippling self-censorship.</description>
